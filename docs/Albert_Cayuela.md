### Project Contribution
* Tasks tracking

  * I made an automated system to know when is every member of the group making a task and control the time and the field of work the member is working on.
  * To get this done I used google questionnaires and google sheets.
  * When a memeber of the team answer a questionnaire about the task, the google sheets document  gets refreshed automatically with the information.
