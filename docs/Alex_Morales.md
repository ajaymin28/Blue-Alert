### Code
 - **Improved basic UI system:** The system is upgraded from the base code from [Axel Alavedra](https://github.com/AxelAlavedra).
 - **Created different button types:** From a base button, I have created different variants:
	 - *Button Dragable*: Button creates an image which spawns troops when the mouse button is lifted up.
	 - *Button Text*: Button with a text inside.
	 - *Button Troops*: Button with a mark that represents the level of the current troop.

	 - *Button Selectable*: Button with two states, selected and notm, which changes on click.
- **Created multiple UI elements:** 
	- *Bar*: The bar represents an element which decreases and increases. The more fluid movement has been implemented by [Marc Guillén](https://github.com/Marcgs96). The change of color is implemented by [Axel Alavedra](https://github.com/AxelAlavedra).![enter image description here](https://github.com/hot-dog-games/Blue-Alert/blob/master/docs/Readme_Files/combat_bar.gif?raw=true)
	- *Scroll Bar*: Bar with a slider that changes a value which is conected.

### Menu Implementation
- **Troop Deploy UI**: With [Laia Martínez](https://github.com/LaiaMartinezMotis) we helped [Marc Guillén](https://github.com/Marcgs96) with the design and the development the troop deploying UI in the combat scene, this UI is able to show the player cards, the current energy available, the cost of each cards and an internal cooldown for each troop depending of their cost and the current energy.
- With the art provided by [Laia Martínez](https://github.com/LaiaMartinezMotis), I have implemented the UI system in the following menus:
	- *Main menu.*
